Chrome User Experience Report Analysis Report

* The Chrome User Experience Report provides user experience metrics for how real-world Chrome users experience popular destinations on the web.

* The Chrome User Experience Report is powered by real user measurement of key user experience metrics across the public web, aggregated from users who have opted-in to syncing their browsing history, have not set up a Sync passphrase, and have usage statistic reporting enabled. The resulting data is made available via:

    * PageSpeed Insights, which provides URL-level user experience metrics for popular URLs that are known by Google's web crawlers.
    * Public Google BigQuery project, which aggregates user experience metrics by origin, for all origins that are known by Google's web crawlers, and split across multiple dimensions outlined below.
